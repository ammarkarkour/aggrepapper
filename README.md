# Aggrepaper
A news aggregator from different APIs. Its aim is to aggregate news from 
different APIs and display them to users, while making it easy for developers 
to add new external news APIs to aggregate news from them.

To build our API we use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). 
Aggrepapper be default aggregates news from two different External APIs, 
[News API](https://newsapi.org/), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/). 
Moreover, our implementation is inhancedwith [Redis](https://redis.io/) 
as a chaching system that works by temporarily storing information in 
a key-value data structure, which we set it to expire after 1 hour in 
case new news articles got published.

The documentations is generated by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

## How To List News?
Aggrepapper is an API that supports two functionalities. The first one is to list 
the aggregated news. To do that, assuming your server is running locally on port
`8080`:

#### `REQUEST`
```
curl  http://0.0.0.0:8080/news/
```

#### `RESPONSE`
```
[
    {
        "headline": "title of the article",
        "link": "link to the original article",
        "source": "the api that this was found in"
    },
    ...
]
```


## How To Search Search Through The News?
The second functionality that Aggrepapper supports is to search the news for
articles that contain the query string.To do that, assuming your server is 
running locally on port `8080`, and you want to search for `tennis`

#### `REQUEST`
```
curl  http://0.0.0.0:8080/news/?query=tennis
```

#### `RESPONSE`
```
[
    {
        "headline": "title of the article",
        "link": "link to the original article",
        "source": "the api that this was found in"
    },
    ...
]
```
